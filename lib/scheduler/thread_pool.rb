module Scheduler
  # ThreadPool manages a pool of worker threads that process tasks from a queue.
  # It maintains a minimum number of threads and can scale up to a maximum number
  # when there's more work to be done.
  #
  # Usage:
  #  pool = ThreadPool.new(min_threads: 0, max_threads: 4, idle_time: 0.1)
  #  pool.post { do_something }
  #
  #  (optional)
  #  pool.shutdown
